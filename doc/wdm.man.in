.SH NAME
wdm \- WINGs Display Manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wdm [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwdm\fP is an X display manager based on xdm(1). It features unique
characteristics, like the ability to reboot or halt the machine (once
the proper password has been supplied). The look of the login panel is
somewhat configurable, too.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
wdm uses the same options xdm uses. Except for \fB\-config\fP, all of
the options can be specified as resources.
.IP "\fB\-config\fP \fIconfiguration_file\fP"
Names the configuration file, which specifies resources to control
the behavior of \fIxdm\fP. \fI@DMDIR@/wdm-config\fP is the default.
.IP "\fB\-nodaemon\fP"
Specifies ``false'' as the value for the
\fBDisplayManager.daemonMode\fP resource. This suppresses the normal
daemon behavior, which is for \fIxdm\fP to close all file descriptors,
disassociate itself from the controlling terminal, and put itself in
the background when it first starts up.
.IP "\fB\-debug\fP \fIdebug_level\fP"
Specifies the numeric value for the \fBDisplayManager.debugLevel\fP
resource.  A non-zero value causes \fIxdm\fP to print lots of
debugging statements to the terminal; it also disables the
\fBDisplayManager.daemonMode\fP resource, forcing \fIxdm\fP to run
synchronously.  To interpret these debugging messages, a copy of the
source code for \fIxdm\fP is almost a necessity.  No attempt has been
made to rationalize or standardize the output.
.IP "\fB\-error\fP \fIerror_log_file\fP"
Specifies the value for the \fBDisplayManager.errorLogFile\fP
resource.  This file contains errors from \fIxdm\fP as well as
anything written to stderr by the various scripts and programs run
during the progress of the session.
.IP "\fB\-resources\fP \fIresource_file\fP"
Specifies the value for the \fBDisplayManager*resources\fP resource.
This file is loaded using \fIxrdb\fP to specify configuration
parameters for the authentication widget.
.IP "\fB\-server\fP \fIserver_entry\fP"
Specifies the value for the \fBDisplayManager.servers\fP resource.
.IP "\fB\-udpPort\fP \fIport_number\fP"
Specifies the value for the \fBDisplayManager.requestPort\fP resource.
This sets the port-number which \fIxdm\fP will monitor for XDMCP
requests.  As XDMCP uses the registered well-known UDP port 177, this
resource should not be changed except for debugging.
.IP "\fB\-session\fP \fIsession_program\fP"
Specifies the value for the \fBDisplayManager*session\fP resource.
This indicates the program to run as the session after the user has
logged in.
.IP "\fB\-xrm\fP \fIresource_specification\fP"
Allows an arbitrary resource to be specified, as in most X Toolkit
applications.
.SH RESOURCES
.PP
wdm uses the same resources xdm does. It understands the following
additional resources.
.IP "\fBDisplayManager.wdmLogin\fP"
Specifies the path to \fIwdmLogin\fP(1x)
.IP "\fBDisplayManager.wdmWm\fP"
Is a colon separated list of window managers to use as options in the
login panel. Note that if you include the path to the window manager,
it will look \fIugly\fP. You may set this resource to None if you want
only NoChange to appear.
.IP "\fBDisplayManager.wdmLogo\fP"
Path to the logo pixmap, several formats are accepted, read
\fIwdmLogin\fP(1x) to find out more.
.IP "\fBDisplayManager.wdmHelpFile\fP"
Path to a text file which will be displayed in the help panel, read
\fIwdmLogin\fP(1x) to find out more.
.IP "\fBDisplayManager.wdmDefaultUser\fP"
a default username which will be used if no username is typed.
.IP "\fBDisplayManager.wdmDefaultPasswd\fP" 
the clear text password of the default user above. BE VERY CAREFUL
when using this two resources, and don't forget to do:
chmod 600 wdm-config ; chown root.root wdm-config
.IP "\fBDisplayManager.wdmBg\fP"
Background specification. Read the next section to find out about the format.
If this is not specified, then the background is \fBnot\fP set.
.IP "\fBDisplayManager.wdmReboot\fP"
Reboot command.
.IP "\fBDisplayManager.wdmHalt\fP"
Halt command.
.IP "\fBDisplayManager.wdmVerify\fP"
If true, verify user's identity for reboot/halt/exit.
.IP "\fBDisplayManager.wdmRoot\fP"
If true, user must be root to exit.
.IP "\fBDisplayManager.wdmAnimations\fP"
If true, enable animations consisting of shaking the panel (if an
error) and rolling up the panel (when closing it).  If false,
animations are disabled.
.SH BACKGROUND IMAGE SPECIFICATION
There are several possible ways of specifing a background image. The
generic format is \fItype\fP:\fIimage\fP. \fItype\fP can be any of:
.TP
.B none
The backgound is \fBnot\fP set.
.TP
.B solid
it renders a solid backgroud, and \fIimage\fP is a color name
.TP
\fBhgradient\fP, \fBvgradient\fP, \fBdgradient\fP
a gradient (either horizontal, vertical or diagonal) will be
rendered. \fIimage\fP is \fBcomma separated\fP of color names, and any
number of colors can be specified.
.TP
\fBpixmap\fP
a pixmap will be used for the background. \fIimage\fP is the full path
to an image file (tiff, png, jpeg and xpm allowed) and it will be
scaled to use the full screen.
