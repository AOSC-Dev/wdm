Thanks to the following people for their contributions
to wdm (formally called DisplayMaker):

Largo <largo@gnu.net>
For the "logo" artwork: The standard/default DisplayMaker logo
is based on the GnuLinux-logo artwork.

Tom Rothamel <tom-xdm@tr.ml.org>
Original creator of the idea of using an external program for
the Login Panel as well as the basic protocol for communication
between greet and the external program (using a pipe to send the
username and password ext->xdm and signals xdm->ext.
Tom created the "xdm-extgreet" package using this idea.
The pip I/O routines are based on Tom's in.c, out.c.

David Reviejo <dreviejo@arrakis.es>
Created a new look for the login panel.	 Cleaner and also made the
help information a scroll view.

Marcelo Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>
For the man pages and debugging.

Alfredo K Kojima <kojima@windowmaker.org> and
Dan Pascu <dan@windowmaker.org>
for creating WindowMaker and WINGs.  Without WINGs, wdm
would not have happened.

Thanks to the folks working on kde for their automake/autoconf
stuff which they did for kdm.

Please see the README file in src/pixmaps (or the WDMDIR/pixmaps
directory for information about the source of the images.
