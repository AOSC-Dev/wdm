See TODO, README, README.pam, and ChangeLog
wdm-1.21 -- Feb 20 2003
	There was a bug. I forgot to change pam service name
	from xdm to wdm. This release fixes it.
	
wdm-1.22 -- Feb 09 2003
	- xdm-base upgraded to xdm from XFree86-4.2.1.
	- wdmLogin translated to russian and japanese.
	Now, what will be in next releases:
	- compatibility with ancient versions of WINGs
	  will be dropped.
	- configuration files will be changed to PropList
	  format (If you want to arue, mail me or chat with me at
	  #wdm on irc.ornet.ru, or #windowmaker on irc.freenode.net)
	- wdm <-> wdmLogin protocol will be changed to implement
	  better PAM support.

wdm-1.21 -- Jan 07 2003
	- development started again. This release collects almost
	  all patches I can find on net. If you have more patches
	  please send them.
	- directories rearranged, build system rewritten (see
	  README.voins for explanations).
	- everything is ready to start migration to newer xdm base.
	
wdm-1.20 -- Feb 29 2000
	- a problem which forbid for some wdm's resources to be set
	  differently for multiple displays was corrected.
	- a problem with incorrect user permissions being set on
	  devices (e.g. mixer) was corrected by replacing some
	  xdm-3.3.2 code with xdm-3.3.6. I think all the xdm stuff
	  definitely should be updated to the latest version.
	- a problem with random wdm hangs under at least FreeBSD
	  was corrected.
	- more detailed installation instructions are given for
	  Linux systems. Feel free to send anything useful for other systems.
	- some messages weren't centered one to each other on the login panel,
	  this looked ugly.

wdm-1.19 -- Sep 21 1999
	- a security problem was present when using the default
	  username and password: they were passed in clear on wdmLogin's
	  command line whenever wdm launched wdmLogin. Now wdm reads them
	  as before, but uses them internally instead of passing them
	  to wdmLogin which passed them back to wdm: it was stupid
	  and was a big security hole, so it's corrected now. ENJOY.
	- a Makefile problem caused wdm-login to not be created at all.
	  This problem was only noticed by new users. It works fine now.

wdm-1.18 -- Sep 16 1999
	- a problem about login name length was corrected
	- a default username / default password can now be
	  set in wdm-config. USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION AND
	  WITH A VERY RESTRICTED ACCOUNT (e.g. no shell, etc...)
	  ELSE YOU COULD VERY WELL OPEN A HUGE SECURITY HOLE TO
	  ANYONE WHO HAS A PHYSICAL ACCESS TO THE MACHINE.
	  AND DON'T FORGET TO: chmod 600 wdm-config
			       chown root.root wdm-config

wdm-1.17 -- Sep 8 1999
	- user environnement settings in /etc/login.conf now
	  propagate correctly to the client session.
	- some modifications were done to compile for Irix.
	- a problem about libz and libpng when configuring
	  was corrected.
	- some cleanups to the source trees and the code.

wdm-1.16 -- Jul 7 1999
	- GFX_LIB_PATH and GFX_INC_PATH now
	  are set correctly in configure.

wdm-1.15 -- Jul 6 1999
	- the pixmaps weren't installed anymore,
	  now it's corrected.
	- wdm's Xsession didn't load X resources
	  before running ~user/.xsession but after.
	- a mailing list was set up (see README)

wdm-1.14 -- Jul 1 1999
	- the warning when compiling TestLogin.c is gone
	- cosmetic changes to the doc

	- add check for libtiff34 as well as libtiff
	- "RollUp" animation finalized as diagonal
	- wdm Xresourses now cleaned up when Xsession is started
	- to simlify configuration/installation on FreeBSD, -lXt is
	  now included (will not hurt even if it is not used)
	- bugfixes
	- configuration changes to make it easier to install and run
	  wdm on different systems
	- minor changes in the "look" of the login and help panels to
	  make them a bit more symetrical.

wdm-0.90 -- beta eight, pre Rel 1.0, Sep 06 1998
	- wdmReconfig for rpm install auto update of Xclients and wdm-config
	- adjust Login panel's "look" to make it more symetrical
	- new "rollup" .. diagonal
	- many changes to ./configure to make it more system independent
	- added --with-local for using /usr/local/{bin,include,lib}
	  appropriately

	- some bugfixes

wdm-0.18 -- beta seven -- Aug 29 1998

	- help now uses a scrolled view for the text and a single button
	  is used to open and close the help panel.
	- many changes to configure for different systems
	- bugfixes
	- new ./configure options --with-winmgr to specify arbitrary
	  windowmanager
	- new wdmAnimations Xresource to enable/disable shake and rollup
	  animations
	- changed wdmBg Xresource so that if it is missing of has the value
	  none, then the background is not set (the user can still set it via
	  other means)
	- chooser is no longer compiled by wdm .. it was not installed
	  anyway.

wdm-0.12 -- beta six -- Aug 24 1998
	- ./configure will now look for a number of window managers and
	  use the found path in Xclients.  It also build WMLIST based on
	  the found window managers.  This can continue to be overriden by
	  the --with-wmlist=<...> option.
	- added Xsession.XFree86 example.
	- INSTALL and README so that INSTALL now contains the
	  configuration and installation information
	- ./configure --with-wmlist=<...> can be used to specify
	  a list of optional window managers which the user can specify.
	  The list is placed into wdm-config.  The default (if
	  not specified is wmaker:afterstep
	- ./configure --with-Logo=<...> can be used to specify
	  alternate file (from .../wdm/pixmaps directory) to be
	  used as the Logo.

	  as the original image.  Smaller images are not resized.
	  The resulting image is centered in the Logo area.
	- some configure parameters changed to lower case:
	  --with-wdmdir=, --with-defuserpath= and
	  --withsystempath=

wdm 0.11 - Aug 20 1998 Gene Czarcinski

	- more porting stuff so this can be compiled on other systems
	- updated Login so it will work with both WINGs 980730
	  (WindowMaker 0.18.1b) and WINGs 980722 (WindowMaker 0.17.5)
	- When compiled with WINGs 980730, the Password Text Entry area
	  uses the new "Secure" mode which displays better
	- The default distributed mode for the wdmVeryify xresources is
	  true -- this requires entering a valid username/password
	  when performing Reboot/Halt/ExitLogin.
