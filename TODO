Here's list of things todo:

- separate program to do configuration for wdm?

- wdmChooser program, replacement for chooser with WINGs look.

- need to reorganize and split Login.c into more than a single file,
  it is getting a bit too big and if chooser code is added, it will
  only get bigger.

- i18n support. There's two different patches for it. One from
  Hiroshi Miura <miura@da-cha.org> available at http://www.da-cha.org/wdm/wdm.html
  and second from Grigory Batalov <bga@altlinux.ru>. I will try to take best from
  both.

- better PAM support. 
  "When a user's password expires wdm simply rejects thier login rather
  then forcing them to change their password like /bin/login does."
  Little reading of PAM documentation and source code showe that PAM support
  is indeed rudimentary, and can be improved. It requires changes in
  wdm <-> wdmLogin interface and major rewrite of greet.c and verify.c.

- migrate configuration files to PropList format. See README.new-config.
