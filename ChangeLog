1.20	- Feb 29 2000 - Jerome Alet
	- Jerome Alet: Modified xdm-3.3.2-resource2.patch to allow
	  most of wdm's configuration resources to be set on a per
	  display basis instead of on a per display manager basis.
	  Modified INSTALL to give more detailed information on
	  the installation procedure for some Linux distros.
	- Matsubayashi, 'Shaolin' Kohji and Mr. Furukawa: Modified
	  src/config/wdm.pamd and patches/xdm-3.3.2-pamwdm.patch
	  according to xdm-3.3.6 handling of the pam stuff
	  correcting the problem with incorrect user permissions
	  settings on devices when the user logged in.
	- Alexander N. Kabaev: Modified Login.c because of signal
	  handling problems: it appears that calling DestroyLoginPanel
	  directly from within the SIGTERM handler could cause wdm hangs.
	- Egmont Koblinger: Modified Login.c to center "Login authentication"
	  and "Welcome to" one to each other.
1.19	- Sep 21 1999 - Jerome Alet
	  Modified Greet.c and Login.c in order to not pass at all
	  the username and password for the default user on wdmLogin's
	  command line. Now wdm does all the bad stuff, wdmLogin just
	  returns an empty username+password to wdm.
	  Modified the manpages accordingly.
	  Modified src/config/Makefile.am in order for wdm-config to be
	  created and installed.
1.18	- Sep 16 1999
	- Miod Vallat: Modified configure.in and Login.c to correctly
	  set the maximum login name length.
	- Jerome Alet: Modified Login.c Greet.c and resource.c to define
	  2 new X resources: WdmDefaultUser and WdmDefaultPasswd which
	  can be set in wdm-config to allow anyone to log in without
	  typing neither a username nor a password. USE WITH EXTREME
	  CAUTION. Modified wdm.man.in, wdmLogin.man.in, wdm-config.in and
	  wdm-config too. Modified src/config/Makefile.am in order for
	  wdm-config to be installed only root-readable because it could
	  eventually contain a clear text password.
1.17	- Sep 8 1999
	- Alexander Kabaev: Modified session.c to allow the environnement
	  settings set in /etc/login.conf to propagate correctly to the client
	  session.
	- Miodrag Vallat: - Modified configure.in to solve the libpng/libz problem.
			  - Added the two Irix patches in the patches subdirectory.
			  - Did some cleanups to the source trees, the manpages,
			  and the code.
1.16	- Jul 7 1999 Jerome Alet with a patch from Don Bottstein
	- Modified configure.in to correctly set GFX_INC_PATH
	  and GFX_LIB_PATH with the help of Don's patch to configure.
1.15	- Jul 6 1999 Jerome Alet with help from Salman Ahmed
	- Modified src/Makefile.am deleting the # before 'pixmaps'
	- Modified src/config/Xsession.in moving the XRDB block
	  before the ~user/.xsession launch
	- Modified README to include something about the
	  mailing list.
1.14	- Jul 1 1999 Jerome Alet
	- Modified TestLogin.c replacing #include <strings.h>
	  with #include <string.h>. The compile time warning is
	  gone.
	- some changes to the doc (README, etc...)
	  talking about the new maintainer.
1.13	- Jun 30 1999 Jerome Alet
	- modified Login.c to allow the tab key to move from
	  the username field to password and back.
	- modified Login.c and Greet.c to incorporate debian's patches
	  to allow MD5 passwords.
1.12	- Jun 18 1999 Berend De Schouwer
	- the configure script was loosing GFXLIBS, now
	  it seems to work fine.
1.11	- Jun 18 1999 Jerome Alet
	- Added a call to XSetInputFocus in order for the login
	  panel to get the focus wherever the mouse pointer is.
1.1	- Jun 11 1999 Jerome Alet
	- fixed a bug in Login.c where wmStr[255] was written but wmStr was
	  declared as being only 16 long. In fact wmStr was not the good
	  variable, it was wmOption[255] instead.
	- update Login.c to compile with WindowMaker 0.60
	- modified Login.c to allow None to be set to wdmWm in order for
	  the user to have only the NoChange choice.
	- modified Login.c Greet.c resource.c to allow a new resource
	  named wdmHelpFile. This resource points to a text file to be
	  displayed in the help panel.
	- modified CreateHelpFrames to compute the help panel size according
	  to the text to display's number of lines.
1.0	- Sep 13 1998 Gene Czarcinski
	- for FreeBSD support, add check for libtiff34 in addition to
	  libtiff; if both found, it should not hurt.
	- update configure.in to support gif stuff (new in WindowMaker
	  0.19.3) -- do both ungif and gif libs even though WindowMaker
	  just uses gif for now
	- even though there is no clear reason for it, FreeBSD requires Xt
	  so add it (it should not hurt anyway)
	- add xrdb -load /dev/null to the beginning of Xsession to cleaup
	  wdm resources
	- remove checking for a number of header files for which nothing is
	  done and, even when not found on some systems, seems to make
	  no difference.
	- finalize the RollUp animation to be a diagonal ... this seems to
	  "look" the best (but of course someone will not think so).
	- fix bug where startkde was found but Xclients was not modified
	  correctly
0.90	- Sep 06 1998 Gene Czarcinski
	- Release 1.0 "candidate"
	- create wdmReconfig.in (wdmReconfig) for rpm post install
	  updating of wdm-config and Xclients
	- if WINGs == 980901, add call to WMSetScrollViewLineScroll
	  to speed up scrolling.
	- add closing rollup options (for now, just in src), to rollup
	  vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.
	- added more information on ./configure options to INSTALL
	- add --with-local ./configure option which will appropriately
	  usr /usr/local/{bin,include,lib}
	- removed --enable-debugWINGs options, this is now controlled
	  by --enable-debug
	- changed animation slightly to make it more "Nextish" (at least,
	  my exposure to what "Nextish" looks like).
	- more fiddling with the size and location of the popup buttons
	  in order to handle better "looking" window manager names
	  (e.g., WindowMaker rather than wmaker)
	- remove the '-t3' from the shutdown commands in wdm-config;
	  add comments and examples for different systems in wdm-config,
	  Xsession, and Xclients
	- fixed configure so that if the shell for login is sh,
	  it is invoked as '/bin/sh -' which is equivalent to
	  '/bin/bash -login'
	- add comment to install about reviewing and changing
	  config files for different systems.
	- slightly change the size and location of the help frame to
	  make it look better.
	- change the size and location of buttons for better symetry
	- fixed code for go button so it works properly
	- delete old xlogin stuff in src/config/Xresources: it was
	  conflicting with other stuff on some(?) systems
0.18	- Aug 29 1998 Gene Czarcinski
	- add the capability to set the proper location for bash and sh
	  in the XSetup_0, Xsession, and Xclients shell scripts.
	- change configure and src/Makefile.am to use GFXLIBS and
	  GFXFLAGS properly ... --with-gfx-libs= and --with-gfx-incs=
	  should now work properly on more systems.
	- change Xclients to add an arbitrarily named window manager
	  since we cannot anticipate all of them.  ./configure is
	  changed to specify it via --with-winmgr and (if needed)
	  --with-winmgr_path
	- fix src/config/Makefile.am (Xsession and Xclients not cleaned)
	- change Xclients, etc. so that the code for window manager
	  programs which are not found are commented out.
	- do not compile chooser since it is not installed anyway.  This
	  will be "fixed" in Release 2 (or something greater than 1).
	- change Xsession to simplify it and attempt to make it more
	  system independent.
	- finally (?) fixed how info and error messages work (redo
	  whole logic).	 It turned out the problem was the order of
	  displaying the messages and doing the authentication (display
	  MUST be first or a race condition results).  Did not have to
	  redo msg handling itself but it did result in simpler code.
	- add new xresource DisplayManager*wdmAnomations to enable or
	  display the shake and rollup animations.  true=enabled,
	  false=disabled; default if not specified is true.  [user request,
	  too slow on some displays]
	- change the way setting the background (root window) is specified
	  so that if it is NOT specified or the value is the literal none,
	  then the background is NOT set.  The user can still set the
	  background via other means [user request].
	- New look for the login panel (supposedly more Nextish).
	  Whether is is or not, I like the new look.
	- Change help to use a ScrollView (this may be 0.18.x dependent) but
	  that is the way it goes.
	- Shuffle the library order to put -lWINGs and -lwraster in front of
	  the other libraries (makes a difference on some systems)

0.12	- Aug 24 1998 Gene Czarcinski
	- add more wdm/Xsession examples
	- make Xclients.in more configurable and add stuff to
	  configure.in so that we locate the various window
	  manager paths and then "build" a wmlist based on
	  what is found
	- updated README and INSTALL
	- add --with-wmlist=< > to specify a list of optional
	  window managers to start
	- add --with-Logo=< > to specify Logo pixmap filename (can be
	  any file since this is used in the wdm-config file)
	- Add code to Login to attempt to keep the same aspect ratio
	  in the Logo image as was in the original image.  If the image
	  is smaller that 200x130, keep it as is.  The image will
	  be cenetered in the Logo display area.
	- add examples of options to wd-config (as comments)
	- make lower case in configure: --with-wdmdir=,
	  --with-defuserpath= and --with-defsystempath=
	- bugfix: configure.in so --with-WDMDIR works properly

0.11	- Aug 20 1998 Gene Czarcinski
	- use two levels of versioning and add a third level for
	  internal stuff only.
	- With the WINGs in WindowMaker 0.18.0 some interfaces changes ...
	  The new WINGs uses WINGS_H_VERSION 980730.
	- WMCreateScreen is different.	If WINGs > 980722, use
	  WMInitializeApplication; WMCreateScreen;
	- configure for -lPropList (I wonder how everthing worked
	  before?)
	- add code to select PopUp item (required > 980722)
	- Thank you Alfredo: if WINGs >980722, use the new
	  WMSetTextFieldSecure function, otherwise continue
	  to resize the area to almost invisible.
	- change the distributed setting of wdmVerify to true --
	  this means that the default for using Reboot, Halt, or
	  Exit is to require the user to enter a valid userid/password.

0.10.4 - Aug 18 1998 Gene Czarcinski
	- man pages for wdm and wdmLogin courtesy Marcelo Magallon
	  <mmagallo@debian.org>.  Now I just have to get them to
	  install properly.  These may need to be changed to _.in
	  files so that they can be "configured" properly to
	  reflect the system on which it is being installed.
	- fix configure.in so looking for wraster (and WINGs) will
	  look in the added paths (should fix debian problem).
	- to be consistant, wdm/config is now named wdm/wdm-config
	- Marcelo's man pages now install
	- Login.c help updated to document ExitLogin's operation ...
	  it terminates the xserver but the daemon must be
	  terminated by other means.
	- apparently, some systems put lots of libraries under
	  /usr/X11R6/lib rather than /usr/lib so lets make it
	  easier for them ... for most libchecks, add  $XLFLAGS $XLIBS
	- fixup how we create the wd._.spec file so versioning is done
	  automagically.

0.10.3 - Aug 16 1998 Gene Czarcinski
	- fix install bug in src/config/Makefile.am on non-pam
	  systems where install-data-local not defined on such systems
	- add --with-pamdir=<xxx> option for use if pam's directory
	  is not /etc/pam.d
	- modified Makefiles to support DESTDIR for all installs ...
	  DESTDIR useful for testing install but especially
	  useful to specify BuildRoot for rpm
	- Add checking for existance of the pam directory and
	  warn user if it does not (but is OK if using rpm BuildRoot)
	- add code to Login to adjust the font size of the name is too
	  long (currently, this is a kluge)
	- add/change code in src/Greet.c so that SessionExit() is called
	  if there is a pipe i/o read error -- this means that the external
	  Login program has failed.  SessionExit will terminate rather
	  than getting into a startup loop. This fixes the "known bug"
	  below.
	- fixup code in src/Login.c so messages (info and error) are
	  displayed properly -- unmap both frames before maping either
	  new one (Clear does unconditional unmap).
	- replace some of the logo and pixmap artwork in src/pixmaps
	- add checking to configure for where WINGs.h is and
	  change how the -lWINGs and -lwraster are defined

BETA 3:

DONE - add more testing for pam

DONE - add test to make sure the Login process has started properly
  so wdm does not loop attempting to start it.	If it does not,
  need to exit wdm.

DONE - create the rpm spec file

DONE - make rpms as well as tarball

DONE - test to make sure that exit verification works

DONE - fix Login code so error messages are displayed properly

work in progress - create README/INSTALL/AUTHORS/?? documentation



0.10.2 - Aug 15 1998 Gene Czarcinski <genec@mindspring.com>
	- add test for xdm source and try to untar if not present
	- second public beta (beta2)

	- Known serious bug: if the fork/exec of wdmLogin fails
	  because it does not exist or is not executable, the
	  wdm will get into an unbreakable loop trying to
	  start it.

BETA 2:

DONE HOPEFULLY - fix automake/autoconf files so this package can be used on other
  systems such as FreeBSD (a big change) ... and it still works
  on RedHat Linux (tested on multiple systems)

DONE - eliminate getopt_long from Login.c ... replace it with getopt
  which is defined in unistd.h and should be available on "most"
  systems ... since getopt only supports simple parameter options
  (no long one), the definitions in the wdm/config file has to change
  ... it is not just data.

DONE - put pam files into the src/config directory

DONE - install the DisplayMaker pam control file into /etc/pam.d
  if --enable-pam is specified

work in progress - create README/INSTALL/AUTHORS/?? documentation

DONE -- DisplayMaker -> wdm
  - finalize the name of this package and fixup any changes.

DONE - during configuration, test if xdm has been untared;
  automatically untar xdm if not; else error (installer goof
  prevention)

0.10.1 - Aug 14 1998 Gene Czarcinski <genec@mindspring.com>
	- fix minor bug in wdm/config
	- put wdm.pamd into src/config and change Makefiles so wdm.pamd
	  is installed as /etc/pam.d/wdm



0.10.0 - Aug 14 1998 Gene Czarcinski <genec@mindspring.com>
	- rename the package/program from DisplayMaker to wdm
	- redo the whole set of configuration files and Makerfiles
	  in an attempt to make this less dependent on Linux so it
	  can compile and run on systems such as FreeBSD.  The approach
	  used was patterned after the one used by kde for kdm.

0.9.0 - Aug 13 1998 Gene Czarcinski <genec@mindspring.com>
	- first public beta

BETA 1:

DONE - create the xdm/Greet.c (xdm/greeter/greet.c) replacement which
  implements the external Login interface.

DONE - ?? automate application of the PAM patch .. patches are applied
  by Makefile

DONE - pam .. the pam definition .. is pam realy enabled/working??

DONE - change service name to DisplayMaker and create pam control file

DONE - move pixmaps under src and add README

DONE - are configs correct for authdir

DONE - update resources.c for specifying Gdm parameters

DONE - rename to DisplayMaker: dmaker and dmakerLogin

DONE - the LoginPanel "look" may need some work

DONE - make reboot and halt work.

DONE - add code to put halt/reboot info into system logs
  ... who did it and any other info

DONE - change resources so only wm, logo, and bg instead of Arg1...Arg9

DONE - make sure (or fix) that we have good Xresources for the user
  ... need to figure out a good Xsession, xinitrc, Xclient set
  ... just doing xinitrc is not good enough .. I wonder just which
  program does load ~/.Xdefaults

DONE - Makefile.am for xdm/config

DONE - configuration files

DONE - fixup cursor so it is a pointer

DONE - add setting of the background in GLogin

DONE - add lots of background setting args

DONE - add a help panel in Login

DONE - add getting the pixmap from a file in GLogin

DONE - add tests of the args passed to Login in LoginTest

DONE - add arg to Login for specifying a pixmap file

DONE - fix in/out so they compile clean

work in progress - create README/INSTALL/AUTHORS/?? documentation

DONE - fix the Makefile.am and configure.in files so they are "more correct"

DONE - ?? is xdm-extgreet tarball needed or just documentation and in/out
  (ask the author??)

DONE - create clean patches

DONE - check with author on logo artwork



0.8.15 - Aug 13 1998 - Gene Czarcinski

	- nearing the first beta
	- pam works (see README.pam)
	- LoginPanel graphics a bit better
	- chooser still the old stuff and not installed
	- no man documentation yet
	- ping not coded
	- DisplayMaker will work with remote system (testing)

0.8.10 - Aug 12 1998 - Gene Czarcinski

	- restructured directories and Makefiles so there is a single
	  source tree, the XFree86 sources are used as a base,
	  and patches are applied in src to create DisplayMaker

0.8.9 - Aug 11 1998 - Gene Czarcinski <genec@mindspring.com>

	- all code working, need to finish some documentation and pull
	  a distribution package together.

	Status of code:
		- chooser still the old code and not installed
		- ping (test if connection is still alive) not implemented yet
		- xdm man page needs lots of work
		- better README documentation
